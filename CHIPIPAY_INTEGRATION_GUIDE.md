# ChippiPay iOS Integration Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to integrate ChippiPay's gasless payment system with your existing Starknet vault iOS application. The integration enables users to make payments for real-world services (phone top-ups, utilities, gift cards) without paying gas fees.

## What is ChippiPay?

ChippiPay is a gasless payment platform that allows users to:
- **Create self-custodial wallets** with encrypted private keys
- **Make gasless transactions** on Starknet mainnet
- **Purchase real services** like phone credits, electricity bills, gift cards
- **Pay with STRK tokens** without gas fees

## Integration Architecture

### Current App Flow:
1. User connects Starknet wallet
2. User deposits STRK to vault contract
3. User can withdraw/transfer from vault

### Enhanced Flow with ChippiPay:
1. User connects Starknet wallet
2. User deposits STRK to vault contract
3. **NEW:** User creates ChippiPay gasless wallet
4. **NEW:** User can purchase services gaslessly using vault STRK

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration
```swift
// ChippiPay API endpoints
let baseURL = "https://api.chipipay.com/v1"

// Authentication
Authorization: Bearer sk_prod_your_secret_key
x-api-key: pk_prod_your_public_key

// Key endpoints:
POST /chipi-wallets/prepare-creation  // Wallet creation
POST /chipi-wallets                   // Save wallet
GET /skus                            // Available services
POST /sku-transactions               // Purchase service
```

### Security Considerations
- API keys stored in iOS Keychain
- Private keys encrypted with user password
- All API calls use HTTPS
- Transaction validation on-chain
- Proper error handling for failed transactions

### Environment Configuration
```swift
// Development vs Production
let environment: Environment = .production

enum Environment {
    case development
    case production
    
    var baseURL: String {
        switch self {
        case .development:
            return "https://api-dev.chipipay.com/v1"
        case .production:
            return "https://api.chipipay.com/v1"
        }
    }
}
```

## Setup Requirements

### 1. ChippiPay Dashboard Setup
1. Create account at `dashboard.chipipay.com`
2. Add JWKS endpoint from your auth provider
3. Generate API keys:
   - Public Key: `pk_prod_xxxxx`
   - Secret Key: `sk_prod_xxxxx`
4. Configure webhook endpoints (optional)
5. Set up development environment

### 2. iOS App Configuration
Add to your app's configuration:
```swift
// In your app configuration
let chippiPayConfig = ChippiPayConfig(
    apiKey: "pk_prod_your_key_here",
    secretKey: "sk_prod_your_secret_key",
    environment: .production
)
```

### 3. Starknet Integration
ChippiPay works on **Starknet Mainnet** while your vault is on **Sepolia Testnet**. For production:
- Deploy vault contract to Starknet Mainnet
- Update StarknetManager to use mainnet RPC
- Ensure STRK token compatibility
