# ‚úÖ Your App is Ready to Build!

## What I Did

I merged all the new code into your **existing files** so you don't need to add any new files to Xcode!

### Files Modified:

1. **`Extensions+Helpers.swift`** - Added `KeychainHelper` class
2. **`ChippiPayManager.swift`** - Added `ChippiPayAPI` class at the top
3. **`AppDelegate.swift`** - Added API key configuration
4. **`HomeView.swift`** - Added test button and function

---

## ‚úÖ Your App Should Build Now!

Just press **Cmd+B** in Xcode to build!

---

## What to Expect

### When You Run the App:

**Check the Xcode Console** - You should see:

```
üì± Configuring ChippiPay for first time...
‚úÖ ChippiPay API keys configured successfully
   Public Key: pk_prod_0f67a3155f8d...
   Secret Key: sk_prod_c035c91fcc9a...
üîÑ Testing ChippiPay API connection...
```

Then one of these:
- ‚úÖ `Connection successful! Found X services`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `Connection successful but no services returned` (normal for new accounts)
- ‚ùå `Connection failed: [error]` (check internet/API keys)

---

## Test the Integration

### Option 1: Check Console
Just run the app and look at the console output. If you see "‚úÖ ChippiPay API keys configured successfully", it's working!

### Option 2: Use Test Button (DEBUG only)
1. Run the app
2. Scroll to the bottom of home screen
3. Look for **"Test API"** button (purple, with network icon)
4. Tap it ‚Üí "Run Test"
5. See result in alert

### Option 3: Test Full Flow
1. Tap **"ChippiPay"** button
2. Try to create wallet (may need Supabase JWT setup)
3. Browse services
4. Check if they load

---

## What's Configured

‚úÖ API Keys stored securely in Keychain
‚úÖ Auto-configured on app launch
‚úÖ ChippiPayAPI integrated
‚úÖ ChippiPayManager updated with real APIs
‚úÖ KeychainHelper for secure storage
‚úÖ Test button added (DEBUG mode)
‚úÖ All code in existing files (no new files needed!)

---

## Your API Keys

```
Public Key:  pk_prod_0f67a3155f8d994796b3ecdb50b8db67
Secret Key:  sk_prod_c035c91fcc9ac3ac6cf7b8a3c2d88bb3c428eecf75d11b18f0006d8b9e84599b
```

These are automatically saved to iOS Keychain on first launch!

---

## Files You Can Delete (Optional)

These files exist in your directory but aren't used anymore:

- `QRPaymentScanner/Helpers/KeychainHelper.swift` (merged into Extensions+Helpers.swift)
- `QRPaymentScanner/Managers/ChippiPayAPI.swift` (merged into ChippiPayManager.swift)
- `QRPaymentScanner/Helpers/ChippiPayConfiguration.swift` (not needed)

You can delete them or leave them - they won't affect your build since Xcode doesn't know about them!

---

## If You Get Errors

### "Cannot find ChippiPayAPI in scope"
- Clean build folder: **Cmd+Shift+K**
- Rebuild: **Cmd+B**

### "Cannot find KeychainHelper in scope"
- Make sure `Extensions+Helpers.swift` is in your Xcode project
- Clean and rebuild

### Other errors
- Let me know what the error message says!

---

## What's Next

1. **Build and run** your app (**Cmd+R**)
2. **Check console** for configuration messages
3. **Test API** using the test button
4. **Try ChippiPay features**:
   - Create wallet
