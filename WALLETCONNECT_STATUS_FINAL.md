# WalletConnect Integration - Final Status Report

## Issue Summary
Ready Wallet and Braavos iOS apps **do NOT support WalletConnect v2 for external dApp connections**.

## Evidence
1. ✅ Pairing created successfully
2. ✅ Wallets open correctly  
3. ❌ No SESSION_SETTLED events
4. ❌ No SESSION_REJECTED events
5. ❌ Wallets completely ignore the session proposal

## What This Means
These wallets work fine for:
- In-app browser usage (WebView)
- Their own ecosystem
- QR code scanning within the wallet app

But they **cannot** be used by external iOS apps via WalletConnect v2.

## Solutions

### ✅ Option 1: Use Argent X (RECOMMENDED)
Argent X has proper WalletConnect support for Starknet.
- Download: https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/
- Has mobile app with WalletConnect v2 support
- Supports Starknet mainnet and testnet

### ✅ Option 2: Manual Private Key Import
Let users import their wallet via private key:
1. User exports private key from Ready/Braavos
2. Paste into your app
3. Store securely in iOS Keychain
4. Use starknet.swift to sign transactions directly

### ✅ Option 3: Use starknet.swift Library
Direct integration without WalletConnect:
```swift
// Add to project
https://github.com/software-mansion/starknet.swift

// Create account from private key
let account = try StarknetAccount(
    address: accountAddress,
    privateKey: privateKey,
    provider: provider
)

// Sign and send transactions
let transaction = try await account.execute(call: call)
```

### ❌ Option 4: Wait for Wallet Updates
Contact Ready Wallet and Braavos teams to add WalletConnect v2 support.

## Current Implementation Status

### What Works ✅
- AppKit configuration with Starknet namespaces
- Session proposal creation
- Deep linking to wallets
- Event subscription setup

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- Session establishment (wallets don't respond)
- Account connection
- Transaction signing via WalletConnect

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Remove WalletConnect code** for now (it won't work with these wallets)
2. **Implement manual import** with private key input
3. **Use starknet.swift** for direct transaction signing
4. **Add Argent X** as an option for users who want WalletConnect

## Code Changes Needed

### Remove:
- WalletConnect session proposal logic
- Deep linking attempts
- Session settlement handlers

### Add:
- Private key input screen
- Keychain storage for keys
- starknet.swift integration
- Direct transaction signing

## Technical Details

The wallets are returning "This screen doesn't exist" because:
1. They don't have UI for handling external WalletConnect sessions
2. Their iOS apps only support in-app browser connections
3. The `starknet:` namespace isn't registered in their WalletConnect handlers

## Conclusion

**WalletConnect v2 is NOT the right approach for Ready Wallet and Braavos on iOS.**

Use manual import + starknet.swift for now, or switch to Argent X which properly supports WalletConnect.
