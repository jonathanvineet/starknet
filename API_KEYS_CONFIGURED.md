✅ **Test API connection** - Verify everything works

⏳ **Not ready yet:**
- Making real purchases (need vault on mainnet)
- Service delivery (need JWKS configuration)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Test Fully:

1. **Deploy vault to mainnet** (currently on Sepolia testnet)
   ```swift
   // Update in StarknetManager.swift:
   static let vaultContractAddress = "0x_mainnet_address"
   static let rpcUrl = "https://starknet-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/..."
   ```

2. **Configure JWKS in ChippiPay dashboard**
   - Go to: [dashboard.chipipay.com](https://dashboard.chipipay.com)
   - Add: `https://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/jwks`

3. **Test with small amount**
   - Deposit 0.5 STRK to vault
   - Make test purchase
   - Verify service delivery
