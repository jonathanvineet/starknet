# How to Add ManualWalletImportView to Xcode Project

## The file has been created but needs to be added to the Xcode project manually.

### Steps:

1. **Open Xcode**
   - Open `QRPaymentScanner.xcodeproj`

2. **Add the file to the project**
   - Right-click on the `Views` folder in the Project Navigator
   - Select "Add Files to QRPaymentScanner..."
   - Navigate to: `/Users/vine/elco/starknet/QRPaymentScanner/Views/`
   - Select `ManualWalletImportView.swift`
   - Make sure "Copy items if needed" is UNchecked (file is already in correct location)
   - Make sure your target "QRPaymentScanner" is checked
   - Click "Add"

3. **Build the project**
   - Press `Cmd + B` to build
   - The error should be gone

## Alternatively, use this command:

```bash
cd /Users/vine/elco/starknet
open QRPaymentScanner.xcodeproj
```

Then manually add the file through Xcode's GUI.

## What the file does:

✅ Provides manual wallet import UI
✅ Allows users to paste private key
✅ Allows users to scan private key QR code  
✅ Securely stores in iOS Keychain
✅ Connects to StarknetManager

## Once added, your app will have:

1. **WalletConnect buttons** (Ready Wallet & Braavos) - Keep trying
2. **Manual Import button** - Works immediately!
   - Paste private key manually
   - OR scan QR code of private key
   - Secure keychain storage
   - Direct connection without WalletConnect
